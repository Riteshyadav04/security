Steps to Perform:
# Step 1: Move to the Downloads directory
cd Downloads

# Step 2: Clone the Zphisher tool from GitHub
git clone git://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git

# Step 3: Move into the Zphisher directory
cd zphisher

# Step 4: Run the tool
bash zphisher.sh

Execution Steps:

After running the tool, it will start in the terminal.

It will show a menu of websites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Google, LinkedIn, etc.).

Choose the number for which you want to create a phishing page.

Example: For LinkedIn → enter 14

Next, it asks for hosting options:

Type 1 for localhost.

When asked for a custom port, type n for No.

The phishing page will now be hosted locally at:

http://127.0.0.1:8080


Open this URL in your browser — you’ll see the fake (phishing) login page.

Enter any test username and password.

Go back to the terminal — the entered credentials will be displayed there.
