Phase 1: Snort Installation & Configuration
Step 1: Install Snort
First, update your package lists and install the Snort package.

Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install snort
Step 2: Configure Your Home Network
You must tell Snort which network to protect. Edit the configuration file (this command opens vi directly to line 45).

Bash

sudo nano  /etc/snort/snort.conf
Change the ipvar HOME_NET line to match your network range.

Bash

# Line 65
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.96.0/24 (your system IP)
IP Usage:  This defines your internal network (192.168.96.0/24) as the one to be protected.

Step 3: Configure Rule & Library Paths
Next, ensure Snort knows where to find its rule files (this command opens vi to line 104).

Bash

sudo vi  /etc/snort/snort.conf
Verify that the paths are set correctly. They should look like this:

Bash

# Lines 
var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules
var WHITE_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules/
var BLACK_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules/

Step 4: Enable Local Rules File
Snort needs to be told to load your custom rules. Go to line 590.

Bash

sudo vi  /etc/snort/snort.conf
Uncomment the line to include local.rules, which is where you'll add your own rules.

Bash

# Line 590
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules

Step 5: Validate Configuration
Before running Snort, test your configuration file for any errors.

Bash

sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Expected Output: You should see a success message.

Plaintext

Snort successfully validated the configuration!

Phase 2: Test 1 - ICMP Ping Detection
Step 1: Create the ICMP Rule
Add a custom rule to detect ICMP (ping) traffic.

Bash

sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Add the following line to the file:

Bash

alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP test"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)



Step 2: Run Snort in IDS Mode
Now, run Snort as an IDS, printing alerts to the console (-A console).

Bash

sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
Expected Output: Snort will initialize and wait for packets.

Plaintext

--== Initialization Complete ==--
   ,,_     -*> Snort! <*-
  o"  )~   Version 2.9.15.1 GRE (Build 15125)
   ''''    By Martin Roesch & The Snort Team
...
Commencing packet processing

Step 3: Generate Test Traffic (Ping)
From your friend's machine (e.g., 192.168.96.x), ping your machine (the one running Snort, e.g., 192.168.96.15).

Bash

# On friend's machine
ping 192.168.96.15
IP Usage: 🎯 Friend's IP → 🏠 Your Protected IP.

Step 4: Monitor Console for Alerts
Watch the terminal where Snort is running. You should see alerts appear for each ping.

Bash

10/29-00:15:16.008427 [**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP test [**] [Priority: 0] {ICMP} 192.168.96.12 -> 192.168.96.15
This shows an alert for traffic from the "attacker" (🎯 192.168.96.12) to your machine (🏠 192.168.96.15).

Phase 3: Test 2 - TCP Scan Detection
Step 1: Stop the Running Snort Process
Go back to the Snort terminal and press Ctrl+C to stop it.

Step 2: Add the TCP Rule
Now, let's add the new rule you wanted to test.

Bash

sudo gedit /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Add this new line below your ICMP rule:

Bash

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"TCP Port 80 Scan"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)


Step 3: Rerun Snort in IDS Mode
Run Snort again just as you did before to load the new rule.

Bash

sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Step 4: Generate Test Traffic (Nmap Scan)
From your friend's machine, use nmap to scan port 80 on your Snort machine.

Bash

# On friend's machine
nmap -p 80 192.168.96.15
IP Usage: 🎯 Friend's IP → 🏠 Your Protected IP (specifically port 80).

Step 5: Monitor Console for Alerts
Watch the Snort console. You will see new alerts for the TCP scan, using the sid:1000002 rule.

Bash

10/29-00:18:22.003141 [**] [1:1000002:1] TCP Port 80 Scan [**] [Priority: 0] {TCP} 192.168.96.12:51234 -> 192.168.96.15:80
This shows the Nmap scan (from a random port 51234) hitting port 80 on your machine.

Phase 4: Analyzing Log Files
When you are finished testing, stop Snort with Ctrl+C. By default, Snort also logs alerts and packets to /var/log/snort/.

Step 1: Locate Snort Logs
Bash

cd /var/log/snort
ls
Expected Files: You will see the alert log and binary log files (with timestamps).

Plaintext

snort.alert.1    snort.log.1757673264
snort.log.1      snort.log.1758856928

Step 2: Read Human-Readable Alerts
The .alert file contains the same alerts you saw on the console.

Bash

cat snort.alert.1
This file will contain detailed information about both the "ICMP test" and "TCP Port 80 Scan" alerts.

Step 3: Read Binary Packet Logs
Snort also saves the full packets that triggered the alerts in a binary tcpdump format. You can read them with tcpdump (or Wireshark).

Bash

sudo tcpdump -r snort.log.1758856928  --> optional and change log id when doing
This will show you the raw packet data for all captured traffic, allowing for deeper analysis.
